An MNIST classifier built completely from scratch, to help understand backpropagation of gradients better. 
The entire notebook is written only in numpy as an attempt to build the ann based solely on the math I know and to strengthen my concepts. 

ISSUES:- 
-> currently one of the issue is that oen of the gradient tensors is having all 0 values. This needs to be looked into, the rest of the implementation is working as expected
